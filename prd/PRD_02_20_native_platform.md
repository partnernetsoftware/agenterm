# Native platform abstraction

Parent: [AgenTerm product tree](../PRD.md#product-tree)

This module owns the native operating-system adaptation boundary used by the
AgenTerm desktop GUI. It does not own terminal, Fleet, Settings, or Hub product
behavior. Those product semantics remain in their existing PRD modules and
consume this layer through typed platform capabilities.

Legend: `[x]` shipped, `[~]` partial, `[ ]` planned.

## Product outcome

- [x] the Platform Facade is an independently consumable
  `crates/agenterm-platform` workspace package. Process and PTY contracts,
  services, private target selection and all three native adapters moved without
  retaining duplicate source. Platform shell defaults live under the process
  feature; shared DPI/geometry conversion is exposed by the window feature.
  Generic host filesystem conventions and cross-process path/slot locks are public while
  AgenTerm directory names, audit filenames and Script concurrency policy remain
  root-package concerns. Typed IPC endpoints, optional serde support, Windows
  named pipes and Unix sockets are public together with typed transport failures,
  bounded I/O and endpoint ownership checks. Only AgenTerm endpoint/workspace
  naming remains in the root package, and IPC capability status is available.
- [x] Clipboard, bounded XRGB screenshot encoding, font-file candidates and
  neutral glyph raster results are reusable crate capabilities. Terminal paste
  limits and HWND/GDI capture remain explicit product extensions; font files,
  DCs and font handles stop inside platform adapters rather than leaking native
  types through the public crate API. Linux/macOS clipboard helpers now consume
  the caller deadline with a 1500 ms adapter ceiling (including one shared Linux
  fallback budget); zero deadlines and helper timeout/size/backend failures stay
  typed through the Unix frontend instead of collapsing to an availability string.
- [x] Normalized modifier/key classification, committed Unicode precedence,
  UTF-16 decoding, and per-platform primary-shortcut policy are reusable through
  the `input` feature. Native frontend event translation remains a root product
  extension. The `ime` feature now owns public preedit/commit actions and
  display-aware status: Linux/macOS are available with a display, while Windows
  remains explicitly Unsupported until native preedit adaptation ships.
- [x] Activation policy and typed native-window requests are public crate API.
  Windows show/no-activate/restore operations and Linux/macOS winit activation
  intent live in target-isolated crate adapters; AgenTerm owns only its window
  lifetime and maps typed failures into the product protocol. Semantic Unix
  activation reports only request intent immediately; matching-host evidence
  must observe the subsequent native focus event and compositor/frontmost truth.
- [x] Script worker process-tree ownership consumes the crate process facade:
  Windows Job Objects and Unix process groups have no duplicate root native
  implementation. Unix guards snapshot transitive descendants before root
  termination and re-check process start identity before killing any child
  that escaped into a nested process group; Linux `Z/X/x` proc states are Dead,
  not live service owners. The cross-group matching-host test is compiled for
  Linux/macOS; exact-SHA `af5ac62` run `30717141687` closed the Linux process-tree
  cleanup receipt and later six-cell runs retained the portable gate.
  AgenTerm-specific audit-path naming remains product policy.
- [x] Product path composition consumes `filesystem::host_directories` and
  `executable_name`; the three root OS path adapters are deleted. AgenTerm
  directory/file naming remains product policy without compile-time OS selection.
- [x] Script Runtime clipboard uses the public crate facade with its independent
  two-second robustness deadline; duplicate root native clipboard adapters are
  deleted and no authorization policy is introduced.
- [x] Script Runtime atomic filesystem mechanics and child-pipe observation use
  public filesystem/process facades. Product budgets and receipts remain in the
  unrestricted runtime; duplicate root native adapters are deleted.
- [x] The optional `process-reference` feature owns stable process-object
  references without reopening by PID: Windows retains an owned process HANDLE,
  Linux retains a pidfd, and macOS retains a kqueue `NOTE_EXIT` registration.
  The public facade exposes only `open`, `id`, `is_alive`, and a platform-neutral
  handle-retention trait; native handle/fd types and implementations stay in the
  selected adapters. Capability status, exact-child exit tests, static boundary
  checks, and Windows/Linux/macOS compile checks cover the public slice.
- [x] Script Runtime child-window observation/input/control uses the public
  process-window contract and selected adapters. Windows uses exact HWND
  delivery. Linux now selects one unique viewable EWMH client by exact PID and
  sends checked X11 key/pointer events only to that client; Wayland remains
  typed Unsupported. macOS selects one exact-PID layer-0 Quartz window and uses
  `CGEventPostToPid` after a non-interactive TCC preflight, preserving distinct
  Unsupported/Failed results. Win32-only messages and child-control operations
  remain explicitly Unsupported on Unix without narrowing caller policy.
  macOS outer geometry remains available, while exact client geometry is typed
  Unsupported instead of returning the WindowServer frame under a false client
  label. AppKit mouse-down handling reads the current event's client location
  directly, so targeted background input does not depend on an earlier
  `CursorMoved` observation. Process-targeted mouse events also carry both
  public CoreGraphics window-under-pointer fields for the exact selected
  WindowServer ID, preventing process delivery from losing intra-application
  window routing while the Control Center remains non-frontmost.
- [x] Passive system-WebView discovery is public and selected inside the crate,
  with Missing and Failed kept distinct. Native font discovery/metrics and an
  opaque RAII font resource are public; the Windows renderer consumes its RAII
  resource and all three duplicate root native font implementations are deleted.
- [x] Windows, macOS, and Linux native frontends consume one declared platform
  contract for window lifecycle, normalized input, IME, DPI, clipboard, font
  discovery, screenshots, activation, and applicable system integration.
- [x] Product-visible UI state, actions, labels, layout geometry, and semantic
  snapshots remain platform-neutral and are not reimplemented inside an OS
  adapter.
- [x] Toolbar hit-to-action mapping is one platform-neutral product table; the
  former three OS-named copies are deleted rather than exported as platform API.
- [x] Display backend facts and headless-aware window status are public crate
  API selected by Windows/Linux/macOS adapters.
- [x] Necessary native differences remain explicit capabilities or typed
  unsupported results; parity never means hiding a missing behavior or forcing
  all systems through a lowest-common-denominator widget implementation.

The tree describes ownership, not a requirement to create one source file per
leaf. macOS and Linux may reuse private Unix implementations without merging
their public capability identities. The first implementation should stay
small and split files only when a stable responsibility needs independent
tests or ownership.

The reusable crate must never depend on the root `agenterm` package. Public
signatures expose no `windows-sys`, `libc`, `rmux-pty`, winit, theme, Fleet,
Control Center or UI protocol types. Product-specific executable names,
environment variables, paths and legacy discovery stay in the root package or
enter the crate only as caller-supplied platform-neutral values.

### Platform Facade closure rule (revision 4, 2026-07-31)

- [x] revision-4 Platform Facade is the sole production native boundary

`agenterm-platform` is not merely a collection of GUI helpers. It is the reusable
middle layer between product code and an operating system. Product/domain
modules consume its typed feature facades, while root `src/platform` contains
only AgenTerm product extensions and neutral error/protocol projection. Product
code does **not** branch on Windows, macOS, Linux, Unix, native handles, or OS
path/identity conventions. The crate's private `selected.rs` and
`adapters/{windows,macos,linux}` are the production implementation sites that
may select an OS with `cfg`; unavoidable binary subsystem attributes and tests
remain structurally explicit exceptions.

This preserves necessary native implementations without allowing OS conditionals
to spread through Fleet, IPC contracts, Script Runtime, Settings, Control
Center, or terminal product state. The facade owns common typed inputs,
outputs, capability facts, and errors; adapters own only OS mechanisms. A
future Web/TUI/agentic projection may consume the same facade contracts without
being forced through an OS widget API.

The migration is complete only when all of the following are true:

- [~] production `#[cfg(windows|unix|target_os|target_family)]` selection for
  reusable mechanisms is confined to `crates/agenterm-platform` private
  selection/adapters and unavoidable binary-entry bootstrap code; test-only
  fixtures are excluded from this count. Root product extensions contain no
  native API or platform-selection implementation.
- [x] `ipc_endpoint`, `ipc_transport`, process identity/tree control, standard
  paths, native activation/clipboard/screenshot, Control Center shell hosting,
  and WebView runtime probing call facade services rather than OS APIs directly
- [x] typed IPC endpoint selection and native listener/stream mechanics are
  owned by `contract::ipc`, `services::ipc`, and selected adapters; the legacy
  duplicate Unix-socket and Windows named-pipe implementations are deleted,
  while platform-neutral framing/server compatibility remains shared
- [~] top-level `win_app`, `unix_app`, and native wake modules are now
  adapter-owned implementation details while shared UI state remains platform
  neutral; physical ownership is complete, while further state normalization
  remains open
- [~] manual and repository-enforced source scanning finds no production
  OS-selection cfg or native API import outside the reusable crate's private
  adapters and necessary binary subsystem attrs. The gate scans every Rust
  source, allows only exact structural exceptions, and its fixture proves
  product markers are rejected while comments and test items are ignored.
- [x] a repository boundary test fails when a new non-platform production
  source file imports OS-native crates or contains an OS-selection `cfg`
- [~] the crate's `selected.rs` is the sole reusable adapter assembly point;
  former root Windows/Linux/macOS native mechanism trees are deleted or moved
  behind crate-private adapters, root product extensions contain no production
  OS selection, and the internal gate rejects selection cfg and native API
  markers elsewhere in contracts or facades
- [x] all three platform adapters satisfy the same facade contract tests; a
  missing capability remains a typed unsupported result, never an implicit
  fallback. One host test loads all three OS-neutral adapter manifests and
  validates revision 3, all eight capabilities, and typed Unsupported/Failed
  probes without compiling another platform's native APIs.

The 2026-09-09 Quick gate exposed that the three `[~]` claims above had moved
ahead of the source. Its first-hit report identifies 30 OS-selection/native
markers across 23 platform facade or contract files. Product-side provider
filename selection now goes through `platform_kind`, and the Unix device court
fixture no longer publishes AgenTerm-branded platform metadata, but facade
assembly is not yet closed. Migrate the mechanically identical adapter selectors
into the root `selected.rs` first. Keep system-broker authority,
privilege/consent lifetimes, contained-process cleanup, device locators, and IPC
selection as separate reviewed increments with their existing typed failure
contracts. The boundary scanner remains strict; do not add facade allowlists to
hide this debt.

## Shared contract

- [x] normalized input distinguishes physical key identity, logical key chord,
  committed text, IME preedit/commit, pointer movement/buttons, wheel motion,
  resize, focus, and scale-factor changes
- [x] text input is not reconstructed from physical key codes when the native
  window system provides committed Unicode text
- [x] shortcuts and text commits remain distinct so Shift characters, keyboard
  layouts, dead keys, CJK input, terminal control keys, and platform primary
  modifiers preserve their native meaning
- [x] platform services are capability-oriented rather than one global
  `OsLayer` object; an adapter exposes only the window, clipboard, font,
  screenshot, activation, or integration capability it implements
- [x] product actions use stable semantic identities such as `toggle-tabs`,
  `toggle-locale`, and `font-increase`; Win32 control IDs, winit events, HTML
  elements, and future TUI keys remain adapter details
- [x] rendering and `ui-snapshot` consume the same resolved labels, states, and
  geometry so semantic evidence cannot claim content different from the
  visible GUI

`agenterm cli protocol-info` exposes the current adapter kind, contract
revision, and all eight typed capability statuses. Client-side and
`--running` server responses use the same schema, so automation can distinguish
Available, Unsupported, and Failed without reading source or assuming parity.

## Platform branches

- Windows
  - [x] contract-revision-1 Windows adapter owns toolbar action mapping,
    UTF-16 committed-text decoding, and Control/AltGr shortcut separation; the
    Win32 `WM_COMMAND`, `WM_CHAR`, and terminal-key hot paths consume it
  - [x] slice-2 owns bounded Unicode clipboard access and typed activation /
    show-without-activation behavior; terminal selection, paste, startup, and
    relayed focus hot paths consume the adapter
  - [x] slice-3 owns bounded GDI full-window and terminal-region PNG capture,
    with RAII resource cleanup, shared strict client-frame clip validation, and
    typed allocation/capture/encoding/`screenshot_invalid_clip` failures
  - [x] contract-revision-2 freezes shared scale-factor validation, logical /
    physical extent conversion, window metrics, geometry-event classification,
    and stable scale error codes; Windows adopts the revision without routing
    its native DPI messages through a Unix abstraction
  - [x] GDI terminal-font creation, metric measurement, glyph-index lookup and
    bounded gray8 rasterization now execute through
    `platform::windows::font`; device-context, font-creation, and metric
    failures have stable typed diagnostics, every temporary DC/font is RAII
    reclaimed, and product renderers receive only neutral alpha coverage and
    placement. The con Windows graph no longer links ab_glyph/ttf_parser;
    Linux/macOS retain file-font parsing in one shared platform adapter.
  - [x] Windows IME capability reporting follows the selected adapter rather
    than a product-side OS exception. Native IMM32 preedit/commit, UTF-16
    cursor conversion and candidate anchoring are shipped, so a displayed
    Windows host reports `available`; a headless probe remains explicitly
    `unsupported` with `headless-display`.
  - [x] contract-revision-3 makes native minimize/maximize/restore snapshot
    state and bounded client resize consume the shared window lifecycle
    contract; Win32 retains HWND sizing and non-client-frame arithmetic
  - [x] the Windows-subsystem launcher and replaceable Win32 GUI projection now
    physically reside in the Windows adapter; product ingress is
    `src/frontend.rs` (see `plan/ARCHITECTURE.md`), not a
    `services::frontend` shim
  - [~] existing HWND controls, GDI rendering, system menu, and remaining input
    behavior are shipped inside the adapter but still need narrower normalized
    contracts around product-neutral state
  - [~] adapt the remaining behavior behind the shared contracts without
    changing the replaceable-GUI/server split or taking ownership of server
    state
  - [x] the first slice preserves native Edit behavior, ConPTY input,
    no-activate, parent-console launcher guidance, and running-image-safe
    development
- macOS
  - [x] contract-revision-1 toolbar hits now resolve through
    `platform::macos::toolbar` stable action IDs before shared product handlers;
    the visible order remains Toggle Tabs, New, then right-aligned Settings,
    locale, font decrease, and font increase
  - [x] the Unix frontend adapter's keyboard and Cocoa IME preedit/commit paths consume
    `platform::macos::input` and `platform::macos::ime`; Command remains the
    product modifier, terminal Control chords remain PTY input, and native
    printable committed text wins for Shift/Option/dead-key, Space, and CJK
    input. Native control-character echoes attached to Enter, Backspace, Escape
    or other named controls do not disguise those keys as text commits
  - [x] the Unix status bar consumes the same descriptive IME contract and
    publishes matching label/bounds in its structured snapshot; macOS reports
    the selected native input mode without guessing unobservable full-width
    state, while a plain keyboard layout remains truthfully `IME: off`
  - [x] physical resize and scale-factor events, logical client sizing, PTY
    resize, layout, and rendering now consume `platform::macos::scale`; the
    no-activate launch path also configures the macOS event loop before window
    creation
  - [x] contract-revision-2 removes the duplicated macOS conversion and
    geometry classifier; the macOS adapter aliases the shared types while
    retaining Cocoa/winit event extraction
  - [x] ordered macOS system-font candidates and availability probing now live
    in `platform::macos::font`; the shared Unix renderer consumes that adapter
    metadata and no longer owns Apple font paths
  - [x] contract-revision-3 shares window semantic state and strict client-size
    validation with Windows while the winit adapter retains Cocoa calls
  - [x] clipboard reads/writes now consume `platform::macos::clipboard` with a
    256 KiB byte budget, live bounded reads, supervised stdin writes, and typed
    failures; native macOS verifies the blocked-writer deadline and product
    Command-C/Command-V round-trip
  - [x] whole-window and pane PNG capture now consume
    `platform::macos::screenshot` with checked dimensions, clips, framebuffer
    length, a 64 MiB RGBA budget, and typed validation/I/O/encoding failures
  - [~] winit/softbuffer windowing, native IME events, system-font rasterization,
    Unicode/color/attribute rendering, cursor, and POSIX PTY interaction are in
    active delivery
  - [~] expose the remaining macOS behavior through the shared platform
    contracts while retaining Apple-native keyboard semantics and scale-factor
    accuracy
  - [ ] signed stable distribution installs a complete signed and notarized
    application bundle; an installer must not replace it with an unsigned
    locally assembled wrapper
- Linux
  - [x] contract-revision-1 toolbar and keyboard hot paths, plus IME and
    clipboard slice-2 bridges, consume `platform::linux` with explicit
    headless/backend failures
  - [x] Linux clipboard: X11 `DISPLAY` seeds and reads the CLIPBOARD
    selection natively (`SetSelectionOwner` / `ConvertSelection`, no
    `xclip` / `xsel` required). Helpers remain a fallback. Read/write
    probed separately, display-matched X11/Wayland selection, wall-clock
    timeouts, live stdout byte budget, typed `clipboard_timeout` /
    `clipboard_too_large` / `clipboard_unavailable`
  - [x] Linux screenshot encode and activation/no-activate (`with_active`)
    consume `platform::linux`; dimensions/pixels/path, strict clip bounds, and
    headless failures are typed; X11/Wayland softbuffer paths Available,
    headless Unsupported; native X11 `DISPLAY=:1` evidence recorded below
  - [x] contract-revision-2 removes the duplicated Linux conversion and
    geometry classifier; the Linux adapter retains X11/Wayland/headless
    capability discovery and consumes the shared typed contract
  - [x] contract-revision-3 shares window semantic state and strict client-size
    validation with Windows while the winit adapter retains X11/Wayland calls
  - [~] winit/softbuffer windowing, X11/Wayland input, system-font fallback,
    clipboard, cursor, scaling, and POSIX PTY interaction are in active delivery
  - [~] expose the remaining Linux behavior through the shared platform
    contracts with explicit X11/Wayland capability facts and headless failure
    diagnostics
  - [ ] packaged launch retains its declared dynamic-library adapter and does
    not require system-wide installation for bundled runtime dependencies

## Boundary and non-goals

- [x] the initial GUI-only boundary did not relocate process, filesystem,
  Script Runtime, Fleet authority, or IPC modules. That limit is superseded by
  revision 4: their OS-specific mechanisms now migrate behind the Platform
  Facade while their product semantics and public contracts stay unchanged.
- [x] the platform layer does not contain product labels, Settings policy,
  tab-tree behavior, Hub navigation, or terminal lifecycle decisions
- [x] `arch/` remains absent until CPU-specific code exists, such as explicit
  x86-64/AArch64 SIMD, assembly, ABI, or atomic implementations; operating
  systems never appear under `arch/`
- [x] no large flag-day rewrite: old paths remain until their replacement
  passes the same public behavior and rendered-evidence gates

## Parallel implementation rules

- [x] the primary agent owns `src/platform/mod.rs`, shared event/capability
  contracts, Windows adaptation, PRD alignment, and final integration
- [x] the macOS agent owns the macOS adapter and macOS-native evidence
- [x] the Linux agent owns the Linux adapter and Linux-native evidence
- [x] platform agents consume the shared contract and must request a contract
  change instead of independently editing its semantics
- [x] commits remain small and merge to `main` early; every adapter commit
  states the contract revision it implements and keeps unrelated product work
  out of the platform migration

## Migration and acceptance

1. [~] freeze normalized event and capability types with table-driven unit
   tests; contract revision 2 owns scale-factor validation, logical/physical
   conversion, window metrics, and geometry classification; revision 3 owns
   window semantic state and bounded client resize; OS adapters remain
   incremental
2. [x] adapt one narrow vertical slice—toolbar labels/actions plus keyboard
   text/shortcut separation—on all three systems
   (Linux hot-path wired through `platform::linux` @ `78f5333`; macOS toolbar,
   keyboard, and committed-text hot paths wired @ `4aadcb0`/`1e6b09c`;
   Windows hot paths and AltGr-safe UTF-16 input are wired through
   `platform::windows`)
3. [~] move IME, clipboard, DPI, font, screenshot, activation, and remaining
   window integration incrementally behind the same boundary
   (Linux IME+clipboard @ `66c54a5`/`b5d54ef`; clipboard helper harden @
   `bf17150`; DPI/scale @ `57958c1`; font discovery/metrics @ `25a45d2`;
   screenshot+activation @ `1b454c2`. Windows bounded clipboard,
   activation, and screenshot capture hot paths are adapted. macOS clipboard
   first cut @ `11ce9b8`, bounded screenshot @ `3811bda`, and Cocoa IME
   preedit/commit @ `91055b6` are adapted; Linux/macOS scale duplication is
   replaced by the contract-revision-2 shared implementation)
4. [~] remove superseded platform-specific paths only after native black-box
   and screenshot evidence passes on that platform

Completion requires:

- [x] formatting and warnings-denied Clippy on every target
- [ ] the same toolbar action identities, ordering, locale, and Settings
  default/terminal-override semantics on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] uppercase/Shift punctuation, Space, control keys, CJK IME, pointer,
  wheel, clipboard, DPI resize, focus, and no-activate behavior exercised
  through native public-interface tests
- [ ] structured snapshots and PNG evidence agree on visible labels, geometry,
  theme, active terminal, modal, and focus state
- [ ] platform failures are typed and diagnosable, with no hidden fallback that
  reports a capability as available when it did not execute

Revision-4 migration evidence (2026-08-01, implementation complete; final
integrated validation recorded below):

- [x] Final serial Windows-host validation passes repository lint, rustfmt,
  PRD alignment, warnings-denied all-target Clippy, 389 library tests, both
  static boundary scans, the three-adapter contract test, the seven-binary dev
  build, CLI help/protocol-info, native IPC smoke, and the full Control Center
  public smoke. The Control Center receipt includes a 760×480 PNG plus
  no-activate, reuse, recovery, exact typed close, and orphan-free cleanup.
- [x] The local Linux-target probe fails before AgenTerm source checking because
  this Windows host has no `x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc`; Linux/macOS native/cross
  compilation remains the existing six-target CI responsibility and is not
  misreported here as local evidence.

- [x] The dependency graph and delivery leaves for the platform-facade migration
  are historical in `plan/archive/plan-platform-facade-v4.md` (completed
  2026-08-01; living structure SSOT is `plan/ARCHITECTURE.md`). They keep
  Script Runtime process/window/clipboard/stream/file work separate from the
  Control Center and PTY/frontend hot paths. That plan grants no runtime
  authority and does not imply Candidate, tag, or public Release.
- [x] Script Runtime `std.process.list` and `std.process.kill`, together with
  owned child-tree cleanup, now call `platform::process` as their only native
  implementation owner. The product module preserves its existing typed Rhai
  receipts; its former Win32 snapshot/terminate, Linux `/proc`/`kill`, macOS
  `libproc`, Job Object, and Unix process-group copies have been deleted.
  `platform::process` is now a compatibility-only facade over
  `services::process → selected → adapters/{windows,linux,macos}`; process
  observation, inventory, termination, child-tree, and CLI autostart native
  mechanics have no remaining root-service implementation copy.
- [x] Script Runtime clipboard bindings now call
  `services::script_clipboard → selected → adapters`. Windows retains its
  two-second Unicode clipboard, UTF-16, and transferable-allocation contract;
  Linux/macOS retain the existing typed Unsupported result rather than silently
  inheriting GUI clipboard timeout or paste-policy semantics.
- [x] Script Runtime child-window facts, keyboard/pointer delivery, native
  messages, bounds, resize, and dialog-control operations now call
  `services::script_window → selected → adapters`. Win32 handles and messages
  no longer appear in `script_process`; Linux/macOS retain the public typed
  Unsupported receipts rather than a silent compatibility fallback.
- [x] Script Runtime atomic promotion, append parent-directory durability, and
  reparse-point metadata now call `services::script_files → selected →
  adapters`. Windows retains verbatim-path `MoveFileExW` promotion; Unix
  retains parent-directory `fsync`; product code keeps its unrestricted-path
  API and existing typed error receipts.
- [x] Script Runtime child stdout/stderr pump now obtains native pipe probe
  tokens and `PeekNamedPipe` availability only through
  `services::script_stream → selected → adapters`. The Windows exited-child
  drain behavior remains bounded; Linux/macOS deliberately supply no native
  probe token, so the portable blocking-reader path remains explicit.
- [x] Script worker supervision and audit serialization now call
  `services::supervisor_audit → selected → adapters`; their former product
  `platform/{windows,unix}` subtrees have been deleted. Adapter-owned Job
  Objects/process groups, global slot locks, and named audit locks retain the
  existing bounded cleanup and cross-process serialization semantics.
- [x] Host path and executable-name conventions now call
  `services::paths → selected → adapters/{windows,linux,macos}`. The root
  `platform::paths` module is compatibility-only; settings, workspace,
  instance-registry, sidecar naming, and terminal font defaults retain their
  existing Windows, Linux, and macOS conventions without target selection in
  product callers. This is convention discovery, not a path permission policy.
- [x] Terminal default-shell discovery now calls
  `services::runtime → selected → adapters/{windows,linux,macos}`. The product
  runtime no longer selects COMSPEC versus SHELL; existing cmd.exe and
  `/bin/sh` fallback behavior is unchanged.
- [x] The Unix new-terminal dialog now obtains its primary shell id, label,
  and program from the same typed runtime facade. Its `zsh` versus `sh`
  selection no longer appears in frontend product code; Windows declares its
  equivalent `cmd` descriptor through the shared contract.
- [x] Unix frontend clipboard calls now traverse
  `services::ui_clipboard → selected → adapters/{linux,macos}` and map native
  availability, size, timeout, and backend diagnostics to one typed contract.
  The adapter-local clipboard helper remains a temporary string-result
  compatibility projection; native frontend ownership is complete.
- [x] Unix softbuffer XRGB screenshot encoding now traverses
  `services::ui_screenshot → selected → adapters/{linux,macos}`. Adapter
  validation and encoder errors retain explicit typed Unsupported/Failed
  results before the adapter-local frontend string projection; the renderer is
  now physically adapter-owned.
- [x] Unix frontend font-file candidate selection now traverses
  `services::ui_font → selected → adapters/{linux,macos}`; the shared glyph
  cache and rasterizer remain shared adapter rendering details, without target
  selection or duplicate candidate tables.
- [x] Linux display capability classification now calls the selected Linux
  scale adapter. The shared geometry contract no longer branches on a display
  target; headless remains typed Unsupported and a usable display Available.
- [x] The obsolete Linux/macOS root native compatibility trees are deleted.
  Unix frontend and Control Center product orchestration now call the public
  crate activation, input, IME, window geometry, and display APIs directly;
  platform facts no longer route back through a root selected native module.
  The Windows-hosted crate tests and Agenterm Clippy lane pass. A local Linux
  target probe is unavailable past the dependency build-script boundary because
  this host lacks `x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc`, so native Unix compilation remains an
  explicit outstanding evidence item rather than an inferred success.
- [x] Native Windows screenshot capture now belongs to the crate Windows
  adapter. The stable public surface accepts an opaque caller-owned window
  handle and neutral window/client capture area, enforces bounded allocation
  and strict clipping, returns typed failures, and keeps every GDI type private.
  Linux and macOS report native-window capture as Unsupported while retaining
  renderer-owned XRGB PNG encoding. AgenTerm remote GUI and Control Center use
  this facade; the duplicate root GDI implementation and clip contract are
  deleted. Control Center file replacement and activation also reuse their
  existing crate capabilities.
- [x] The final root Windows `native` compatibility module is deleted. The
  replaceable GUI consumes public crate activation and input APIs directly,
  preserving typed activation diagnostics, Control/AltGr arbitration, and the
  stateful UTF-16 decoder. Win32 GUI host/render ownership remains open and is
  not claimed complete by removing this projection layer.
- [x] Windows launcher wake delivery and parent-console diagnostics now use
  public crate activation/process facades. `PostMessageW`, standard-handle
  probing, attach-only parent-console behavior, and console cleanup remain in
  the Windows adapter; AgenTerm keeps only wake coalescing, GUI argument policy,
  and IPC handoff. The root frontend entry no longer imports Win32 APIs.
- [x] macOS primary-shortcut arbitration is Command/meta-only. Control remains
  available to terminal control-key encoding (including Ctrl-C) instead of
  being misclassified as a product shortcut; a target-neutral contract test
  protects this invariant even on non-macOS development hosts.
- [x] Windows Control Center native shell mechanics now live behind the public
  generic `NativeTextWindowHost` extension boundary. Window creation, message
  loop, timer, GDI text paint, focus, close, title and invalidation are crate
  adapter responsibilities; the main crate retains Control Center state and
  maps it through the neutral host trait. Linux/macOS currently return typed
  Unsupported from this runner until their pixel-surface host is connected.
- [x] Linux/macOS native text-window hosting is now connected through the same
  public trait. The crate shared Unix adapter owns winit event loops/windows,
  softbuffer surfaces, raw identity extraction, resize/present, focus, polling,
  and renderer-frame receipts. Root Control Center services use one product
  bridge on all three targets and no longer select OS shell implementations.
  A Windows-hosted Linux-target all-feature Clippy run passes with warnings
  denied; it also exposed and closed stale PTY, clipboard-timeout and IPC-test
  cross-target compile defects.
- [x] Native dependencies are isolated by Cargo capability feature. Win32
  module features are forwarded from process, filesystem, locking, IPC,
  window, clipboard, screenshot, and font rather than declared as one global
  union. Default and each individual capability compile independently; on
  Windows the minimal process/filesystem dependency trees contain only
  `windows-sys -> windows-link` and do not activate UI/GDI/clipboard modules.
- [x] PTY and clipboard no longer imply the aggregate process capability.
  Product-neutral `parent-console` and `runtime` features independently own
  launcher output and terminal defaults; `process` retains compatibility
  wrappers by aggregating those narrow mechanisms. Lightweight hosts therefore
  declare actual needs without compiling process inventory, control, metrics,
  security, observation, containment, image, or spawn surfaces.
- [x] Screenshot and font capabilities no longer imply aggregate filesystem
  access, and IPC no longer implies path locking. Their adapters have no such
  calls: screenshot owns encoding/capture, font owns discovery/rasterization,
  and IPC owns native endpoint binding plus caller identity. Embedders that
  need publication or locking declare those orthogonal mechanisms explicitly.
- [x] The optional Windows `app-container-profile` feature owns profile/SID
  mechanics needed by external platform-crate callers without making them
  reconstruct native capability identities or pass potentially unaligned SID
  storage to Win32. The adapter exposes caller-owned, canonically printable
  Internet Client, Internet Client/Server, and Private Network Client/Server
  well-known SIDs; profile creation/deletion remains explicit, and invalid
  input, existing profile, HRESULT, and `GetLastError` failures remain typed
  without an implicit retry or mutation. This is a native lifecycle primitive,
  not Agent authorization, a Script Runtime restriction, an allowlist, or an
  automatically applied sandbox policy. Windows-hosted tests own exact SID
  identity, unaligned borrowed input, deterministic profile derivation, and
  explicit create/existing/delete behavior.
- [x] The dependency-free `process-conventions` feature lets external callers
  prepare Windows process parameters without copying quoting logic or opening a
  process. It rejects empty argv and embedded NULs with indexed typed errors,
  round-trips CRT/`CommandLineToArgvW` quoting on a Windows host, and emits a
  double-NUL UTF-16 environment block after stable locale-independent Unicode
  case folding and name sort as required by `CreateProcessW`. Malformed
  environment entries are explicitly rejected or skipped; equal folded names
  retain caller order. The helper does not spawn, select an executable, decide
  duplicate-variable policy, mutate the caller environment, or impose Agent or
  Script Runtime permissions. Minimal-feature Windows tests prove all five
  contracts without enabling `process-spawn`.
- [x] Windows PTY and runtime capabilities share one selected-adapter owner for
  the system UTF-16 environment block. It pairs `GetEnvironmentStringsW` and
  `FreeEnvironmentStringsW`, exposes only bounded borrowed units and fixed
  ASCII-key lookup internally, and keeps ConPTY merge and runtime defaults from
  duplicating native ownership. The measured x86_64 lookup leaf uses inline
  assembly with explicit non-aliasing register constraints; Windows aarch64
  retains the same contract in Rust, while Linux/macOS remain behind the common
  facade. Missing or malformed blocks fail without exposing raw pointers to
  products.
- [x] The Windows font adapter retains lazily created GDI faces for one active
  pixel size on their creating thread. It does not mark NULL-compatible HDCs as
  `Send`; size changes drop the complete RAII set, restoring the previous font
  and deleting every HFONT/HDC. TLS teardown or reentrant borrowing fails with
  a typed raster error. A deterministic 94-glyph probe proves one native face
  creation at a stable size, while Unix/macOS retain their OnceLock-backed
  file-font renderer behind the same neutral raster facade.
- [x] Window minimized/maximized/restored semantic state and native-flag
  precedence are public platform-neutral window contracts. AgenTerm's 320x240
  CLI resize minimum and error wording remain product policy in the main crate.
- [x] The public input contract now includes a native-library-free normalized
  key event with logical/named keys, bounded physical identity, press/release,
  repeat, committed text and modifier snapshot. Shift+Tab is explicitly
  preserved as named Tab plus Shift. Product composer/tmux/PTY-byte policy
  remains in the main crate; adapters own winit/Win32 event conversion.
- [x] Linux/macOS selected input adapters implement winit-to-contract key
  normalization inside the crate. Logical/named/physical keys, element state,
  repeat and committed text cross the public extension boundary only as crate
  types. Linux-target warnings-denied Clippy compiles focused mapper test targets
  for Shift+Tab and stable letter/digit identity; native execution remains CI evidence.
- [x] The root Unix product input consumer now receives only normalized crate
  events. Native key/modifier conversion occurs once at the event-loop adapter
  boundary; composer, text-field, terminal-shortcut and PTY-byte rules no longer
  import or accept winit types. The strict production boundary report is down
  from eight violations to seven, all owned by the remaining window hosts and
  final root target selector.
- [x] Unix product window-state policy is native-library neutral. UI action
  parsing, semantic tracking and snapshot projection depend on an abstract
  window behavior surface plus the crate `WindowSemanticState`; winit window,
  event and logical-size types are confined to the one remaining frontend host
  integration point. The strict production boundary report is down to six
  findings pending that host, Windows remote GUI and final root selection.
- [x] The root Unix wake bridge no longer stores or exposes a native event-loop
  proxy. Producers retain the product coalescing signal and call a neutral wake
  callback installed by the selected host; IME and wheel product handlers also
  accept only crate events and neutral deltas. Native conversion is localized
  in the remaining frontend host, reducing the strict boundary report to five
  findings.
- [x] The root Unix pixel frontend now runs through the public crate
  `PixelWindowApplication` extension. Linux/macOS adapters own the winit event
  loop/window, softbuffer surface, native event normalization,
  resize/buffer/present lifecycle and cross-thread `WindowWaker`; product
  layout, terminal, selection, command and screenshot policy remain in the main
  crate. Root Cargo no longer directly depends on winit or softbuffer. The
  Windows-hosted all-target check, crate all-feature warnings-denied Clippy and
  46 crate tests pass. This host still cannot compile the root Linux target
  past ring's build script without `x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc`, so native Unix source
  compilation remains CI/host evidence. The strict boundary report is now three
  findings: Windows remote GUI host plus the final root selector.
- [~] The same `PixelWindowApplication` contract now has a feature-gated native
  Windows pixel host using a User32 message loop, owned XRGB frame and GDI
  presentation instead of winit/softbuffer. Cross-thread wake uses an atomic
  HWND lifetime token; one Win32 timer owns WaitUntil; queued paint is drained
  before AboutToWait so a fast child cannot report exit before its final PTY
  output is rendered. The con owner passes 70 unit tests, its public-control GUI
  black box, and 16 active terminal black-box cases with zero failures. This is
  selected con host now also consumes the existing IMM32 composition cache,
  emits preedit/commit events, suppresses raw composing WM_CHAR echoes, anchors
  candidate/composition windows in the client coordinate space required by
  IMM32, captures pointer gestures and reports capture loss, tracks real mouse
  leave, and applies checked WM_DPICHANGED suggested rectangles. GCS_CURSORPOS
  UTF-16 units are converted to contract char indices without splitting
  surrogate pairs. Human Chinese-IME input acceptance remains an explicit gap.
  The owning platform lib suite is 70/70: its former Windows-unsupported runner
  test is feature-gated correctly, while the native runner test exits from
  `opened` and proves deterministic window destruction. This removed a real
  harness defect that left one locked test executable after every timed-out
  native-feature run.
- [x] Pixel-window host selection is now a real Cargo boundary rather than a
  source-only cfg. `window` owns the typed contract and OS API surface,
  `portable-pixel-window` owns winit/softbuffer, and `native-pixel-window` owns
  the Windows User32/GDI implementation. The root workbench explicitly selects
  portable behavior; the independent con package selects native on Windows and
  portable on Linux/macOS. Cargo's resolved normal graph proves the Windows con
  path contains neither portable GUI dependency.
- [x] The Windows remote GUI now consumes the frozen typed `control_window`
  boundary. The dedicated neutral host owns Win32 class/window/child
  controls, pre-translation key preview, WndProc/message loop, focus/capture,
  system menu, GDI double buffering and native capture. The main crate retains
  server/client, tab/tree/composer/settings/theme, selection/scrollback,
  close-policy, snapshot and paint-composition decisions, expressed only as
  control IDs, normalized events, neutral rectangles/colors and canvas calls.
  The completed dependency order was contract, native host, product
  integration, native import deletion, then final root selector deletion.
  Raw-handle or closure
  forwarding facades are explicitly excluded because they would preserve the
  ownership leak instead of establishing the external crate boundary.
- [x] The neutral control-window contract and selected Windows native host are
  implemented in `agenterm-platform`. The host owns native class/window/child
  controls, the timer/message loop, deferred destruction, pre-translation
  consumable key preview for child edits, minimized resize facts, UTF-16 text
  decoding, named-key normalization, capture/focus/cursor/control operations,
  and one double-buffered GDI present per paint. Zero-size paints are ignored,
  native menu/surface/present failures are typed, and the class deliberately
  omits horizontal/vertical redraw styles. Linux/macOS return typed
  Unsupported. Product `RemoteWindowState` now implements the neutral
  application/event/query/paint contract; native automation, selection-aware
  EDIT copy/paste, no-activate restore, synchronous screenshot paint, fonts and
  menus route through the host. The product file contains no native import,
  handle or unsafe block. Evidence: `d9138ab`, 12 owning tests.
- [x] The control-window host now preserves native EDIT selection semantics
  through typed copy/paste operations and synchronously flushes a requested
  redraw before native PNG capture, so structured snapshot state and captured
  pixels cannot describe adjacent frames. The same increment exposes private
  state-directory/file primitives through the crate filesystem feature: Unix
  requests `0700` directories and exclusive `0600` files, while Windows keeps
  the caller-owned inherited ACL. All-feature crate Clippy and 51 tests pass;
  the minimal filesystem feature Clippy and three tests pass. Evidence:
  `d81ce70`, `f85ffeb`.
- [x] The integrated Windows control host preserves both queued keyboard input
  and directly sent automation keys without double dispatch, and uses stable
  validated menu command IDs below the Win32 reserved range. The complete
  public `remote-ui-smoke` passes window close/detach/reconnect, navigation,
  settings/CWD, resize/tree/scroll, terminal selection copy/paste and server
  recovery. Evidence: `a9f1c90`, `d056888`, `ux.system-menu-clipboard`,
  `ux.terminal-selection-copy`, `ui.replaceable-client`.
- [x] Cross-platform product interaction policy now lives in
  `src/frontend/interaction.rs`: focus navigation, wheel accumulation, wheel routing, raw-mouse arbitration, scrollbar thumb drag and
  modal/focus state is shared through `FocusState`; both adapters consume the same raw-mouse
  arbitration, xterm mouse report encoder/outcome, and Windows remote publishes `raw_mouse_arbitration: true`.
  Each adapter maps native controls/modal flags into `FocusState`\n  through one `focus_gate()` projection; both frontends store the semantic surface in\n  `FocusState` and keep native controls as projections.
  Evidence: `src/frontend/interaction.rs` unit tests and Quick Gate.
- [x] Product capability mapping and native IPC endpoint naming now live in
  `src/platform/policy/{capability,ipc}.rs`; `src/platform/mod.rs` re-exports
  the tables and no longer owns those implementations.
  Evidence: Quick Gate and platform contract tests.
- [x] Root IPC, Script-host availability, supervisor-audit path policy and XRGB
  screenshot encoding no longer require selected adapter modules. They compose
  product paths/capability facts from the crate `PlatformKind` or call the crate
  facade directly; twelve duplicate product adapter files are deleted.
- [x] Control Center state-directory protection, exclusive state-file creation,
  focus, capture and atomic replacement now use typed public crate facades.
  Its three root platform adapters are deleted and failures are propagated
  rather than silently ignored. The final cfg-free frontend and Script HTTP
  services preserve Windows NativeTls/platform roots and Unix Rustls/WebPKI;
  root `selected.rs`, two frontend wrappers and three TLS adapters are deleted.
  Root Cargo no longer directly depends on `windows-sys` or `rmux-pty`.
  Evidence: `2644ba7`, 458 lib tests, warnings-denied all-target Clippy, seven
  boundary tests and target-specific ureq feature trees.
- [x] Passive system-WebView runtime discovery now calls the external crate
  facade directly. Root services contain no target selection; WebView2, WebKitGTK,
  and WKWebView filesystem probes remain passive and preserve their existing
  Detected/Missing/Failed facts. AgenTerm continues to use its native renderer.

- [x] `settings`, instance PID/start-identity checks, terminal default-shell
  selection, Control Center atomic-file/focus/capture routing, and passive
  WebView runtime probing now call typed `platform::{paths,process,runtime,
  control_center,webview}` services. Script Runtime's owned child-tree call
  path now uses `platform::process`; it retains its existing typed receipts.
  Control Center sidecar executable naming and registry PID/start-identity
  matching also now consume `platform::{paths,process}`. Control Center's
  projection/registry/IPC receipts remain in the product layer behind a typed
  host, while selected Windows/Linux/macOS shell adapters own native event
  loops, rendering, no-activate behavior, focus, window identity, and frame
  capture. Windows public no-activate evidence opens the adapter-owned shell,
  captures a 760×480 native PNG, closes it, and observes `not_running` with no
  residual owner.
- [x] The approved PTY boundary exposes normalized spawn, size, exit, and
  session/reader/wait operations only. POSIX `openpty`/fork/session/exec/poll
  and Windows ConPTY/job mechanics reside below selected adapters while
  retaining concurrent reader/wait and terminate-to-EOF ordering.
- [x] POSIX PTY allocation, fork/session/exec, resize, polling, and child
  lifecycle code now physically resides in `adapters/linux/pty.rs`; macOS has
  an explicit adapter entry over that private POSIX mechanism. The Windows
  adapter directly owns ConPTY, cancellable input, output draining, process wait
  and Job Object cleanup behind neutral terminal size/process identities.
  `src/pty` is now an OS-neutral compatibility
  projection over `services::pty → selected → adapter`; reader/wait concurrency,
  exit-triggered pseudoconsole close, and force-terminate ordering remain in
  the existing runtime path. Spawn, resize, reader/wait handle cloning, wait,
  and force-terminate now return the shared typed `Unsupported`/`Failed`
  lifecycle contract with stable failure codes; byte reads/writes retain their
  standard I/O semantics.
- [x] native IPC identity, default endpoint/workspace derivation, listener /
  stream framing, named-pipe and Unix-socket mechanics, permissions, peer
  identity, and stale recovery now reside beneath `src/platform/`; the
  product-facing `ipc_transport` is an OS-neutral shim. Legacy TCP and the
  v1/v2 instance schema remain unchanged. The final adapter split and both
  repository-wide static closure gates pass. On 2026-08-02 clean Windows SHA
  `274f971`, `native-ipc-smoke` re-proved named-pipe/TCP selection, mixed-schema
  discovery, PID-reuse-safe stale cleanup and authority recovery, while
  `native-ipc-compat-smoke` verified exact published v0.1.10/v0.1.11 bytes,
  native upgrade, HEAD state persistence and rollback reads. This Windows
  receipt does not substitute for new Linux/macOS matching-host runs.
- [x] `LogicalInstance`, `ServerScopeId`, typed `IpcEndpoint`, endpoint
  selector, and legacy migration contract now live in
  `platform::contract::ipc`; `src/ipc_endpoint.rs` is compatibility-only.
  The contract's 11 focused tests retain main/dev separation, opaque identity,
  selector priority, legacy TCP parsing, and serialization evidence.
- [x] Typed IPC transport errors (`UnsupportedEndpoint`, endpoint validation /
  collision, bounded connect / accept timeout, and I/O) now live in
  `platform::contract::ipc_transport`. TCP compatibility framing and all three
  native adapter implementations consume that one error contract; the root
  `ipc_transport` module is an OS-neutral compatibility projection.
- [x] IPC adapter implementations are now physically selected from
  `platform::adapters/{windows,linux,macos}/ipc.rs`; macOS reuses the private
  Unix mechanism while keeping its own adapter identity. `selected.rs` is the
  only IPC target selector. Native endpoint bind/connect/accept and stream
  I/O now traverse `services::ipc → selected → adapter`; the former native
  transport implementation copies are deleted.
- [x] Native stream interop exposes standard borrowed and owned handle/fd
  semantics without moving native mechanics into the public facade. The
  target-selected `NativeStreamExt` trait and standard descriptor trait impls
  live in Windows/Unix adapters; `ipc.rs` only re-exports the selected extension
  and keeps a neutral stream wrapper. Integrated run `30718584882` caught the
  first facade-level implementation through the no-native-mechanics boundary
  test (490/491 otherwise passed); the adapter-owned form closes that failure
  without adding a boundary whitelist.
- [x] Script Runtime HTTP TLS provider/root-store selection and
  platform-specific TLS-error classification now traverse
  `services::script_http → selected → adapters`; the Rhai HTTP surface keeps
  its existing bounded timeout, proxy, response, and typed-error behavior.
- [x] CLI server autostart now calls `platform::process`; Windows Job
  breakaway, executable discovery, and null-stdio child creation are adapter
  mechanics, while unsupported hosts preserve the former no-autostart retry
  behavior.
- [x] Script worker sidecar executable-name conventions now resolve through
  `platform::paths`; client discovery no longer branches on `.exe` naming.
- [x] Workspace persistence now obtains its default Windows/Unix and
  instance-scoped path from `platform::paths`; the workspace domain no longer
  branches on LOCALAPPDATA, XDG, or server-scope conventions.
- [x] Windows-hosted `cargo fmt`, warnings-denied Clippy, focused facade/unit
  tests, `agenterm cli --help`, both static boundary gates, and the same-host
  three-adapter contract test pass for the integrated revision-4 tree. Final
  Quick/build/public-smoke receipts are recorded only after the closing serial
  validation run.

  all-target/all-feature Clippy, 296 library tests, a 537 ms no-activate first
  window, and the complete replaceable-GUI remote smoke all pass

macOS hot-path evidence (2026-07-30):

- [x] `cargo fmt --check` and all-target warnings-denied Clippy pass
- [x] 445 library tests pass; focused macOS adapter tests cover stable toolbar
  order/IDs, Command versus terminal Control, Shift punctuation,
  Option/dead-key composition, Space, CJK IME preedit/commit, clipboard byte
  and timeout failures, screenshot bounds/failures, invalid scale metrics, and
  Retina scale-factor changes
- [x] native Cocoa GUI smoke with `AGENTERM_NO_ACTIVATE=1` produces a structured
  960x600 logical snapshot and a 1920x1200 Retina PNG; toolbar labels/order,
  locale, focus, window state, and layout geometry agree; the Unix/macOS
  snapshot publishes bounds for all six rendered toolbar controls, matching
  the Windows snapshot shape
- [x] native Accessibility resize produces an 800x468 logical snapshot and a
  1600x936 Retina PNG with zero GUI stderr; the same no-activate probe preserves
  the previously frontmost application
- [x] native Command-C/Command-V round-trip copies and pastes the exact composer
  marker through the macOS adapter; public CLI capture produces a 1920x1200
  whole-window PNG and a 1560x928 pane PNG, both under the adapter budget
- [x] the macOS clipboard writer is supervised in source; the blocked-pipe
  regression test and native Command-C/Command-V smoke pass on macOS

Cross-platform integration review (2026-07-30):

- [x] Linux screenshot requests that extend outside the framebuffer return typed
  `screenshot_invalid_clip` and do not write a silently shrunk PNG. Native
  Linux verification (2026-07-30): `cargo fmt --check`; warnings-denied
  all-target/all-feature Clippy; **8** `platform::linux::screenshot` unit tests
  (including overflow-clip reject-without-write); X11 Available / Wayland
  Available / headless Unsupported capability statuses plus activation
  `--no-activate` / `AGENTERM_NO_ACTIVATE=1` on native `DISPLAY=:1`; public CLI
  whole-window PNG **950×594** and pane PNG **702×459**
- [x] macOS clipboard write timeout covers blocked stdin delivery as well as
  child exit; native macOS executes the blocked-writer deadline test in 0.06
  seconds for the focused four-test suite

Contract-revision-2 local evidence (2026-07-31):

- [x] Windows-hosted shared platform tests pass **24/24**, including shared
  unit/fractional scale conversion, zero-size resize handling, typed invalid
  metrics, and all three adapters declaring revision 2
- [x] Windows warnings-denied library/test Clippy and `git diff --check` pass
- [x] Windows GDI font adapter tests pass **15/15** for the Windows platform
  slice; an incremental six-executable build and public no-activate startup
  smoke pass with a **570 ms** first native window
- [x] public `agenterm cli protocol-info` reports the current contract revision and all
  eight Windows capability statuses; IME preedit and undeclared shell
  integration are explicit Unsupported results rather than false availability

Contract-revision-3 local evidence (2026-07-31):

- [x] shared window tests prove native-state precedence and strict
  320×240-to-`i32::MAX` client-size bounds; Windows and Unix `window-resize`
  hot paths consume the same typed validation
- [x] Windows Quick Gate passes repository lint, formatting, PRD alignment,
  warnings-denied all-target Clippy, and **303** library tests
- [x] CI run
  [`30565063423`](https://github.com/mgttt/agenterm/actions/runs/30565063423)
  passes Windows, Linux, and macOS on x86-64 and ARM64. The Linux x86-64 job
  also passes the portable Quick Gate, cross-platform automation audit,
  manifest client build/probe, and public Script CLI test; Windows passes its
  public startup/CLI slice
- [x] contract revision 3 is release-qualified for v0.1.10. Broader normalized
  pointer/wheel/IME ownership and the remaining adapter migrations above stay
  explicitly partial instead of being relabeled as shipped
