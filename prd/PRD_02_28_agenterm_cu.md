# Computer-use foundation (`agenterm-cu`)

Parent: [AgenTerm product tree](../PRD.md#product-tree)

This module is the root of the `agenterm-cu` product subtree. It owns the
product definition, the boundary against every existing observation/control
surface, the governing invariants, and the promotion gates. Its four child
modules own third-level requirements.

`agenterm-cu` is in active partial delivery. Its executable identity, command
shell, macOS host, runtime `libagenterm` boundary, Windows desktop-host ABI 1.7,
and Windows UIA backend have owning implementation evidence. The UIA claim is
backed by five pure tests, two real Win32 UIA fixture tests, and the passing
staged public `cu-windows-smoke` with all seven declared evidence receipts.
Candidate qualification and release are not claimed. This subtree root remains
partial, and each child marks only the capability supported by its own named
evidence.

Legend: `[x]` shipped, `[~]` partial, `[ ]` planned.

## Subtree map

`agenterm-cu` is organized as four child modules under this root, plus the
platform-accessibility backends that live under targets/transports. Platform
accessibility backends are an explicit branch under targets/transports — not a
footnote inside a table.

```

Structured `tree` observation and `click` / `focus` by node identity are
provided by these native accessibility stacks (see
[30 § Platform accessibility backends](PRD_02_30_cu_targets_transports.md#platform-accessibility-backends)).
Screenshot and coordinate actuation are **degraded fallbacks** with typed
markers in the command result; they are never silent substitutes for a missing
control tree. `agenterm-cu` consumes `libagenterm` as its runtime mechanism
boundary; it does not open raw OS APIs or fork a fifth screenshot stack.

## Current delivery truth

- [x] `agenterm-cu` is the only product executable. CLI and desktop-host modes
  share that binary; an executable named `cu` is not a compatibility surface.
- [x] CU is the first runtime consumer of the `libagenterm` dynamic library.
  Product code owns command and action meaning while ABI/platform layers own
  native mechanisms.
- [~] On Windows, the product `Command`/`Executor` path consumes UIA tree,
  Value, Invoke and Focus through the runtime `agenterm.dll`; it neither opens
  COM/UIA directly nor caches native interfaces. The platform backend uses an
  MTA-capable per-operation session, bounded UIA and wall-clock timeouts,
  `SetAutoSetFocus(FALSE)`, and RuntimeId re-resolution for every node action.
  Structured UIA failure is typed and never silently becomes a coordinate
  click. Five pure and two real fixture tests own the adapter evidence; staged
  `cu-windows-smoke` owns the public DLL-backed journey.
- [x] Windows runtime window enumeration follows a two-stage
  required-size/fill ABI. If desktop churn makes the fill call report
  `required > capacity`, the caller retries with a fresh capacity under a hard
  attempt bound; it never truncates, writes beyond capacity or spins forever.
- [~] Windows desktop-host ABI 1.7 implements notification-area menu projection,
  `RegisterHotKey`, polling and cleanup for the CU host's 18 placement actions
  plus Quit. A native `target/abi-dev` `host --self-test --json` run reported
  `actions=19` and `cleaned_up=true`.
- [x] Local `dist` staging colocates `agenterm-cu.exe` and `agenterm.dll`; the
  staged `cu-windows-smoke` proves version, dynamic-library load, 19 desktop
  actions and deterministic cleanup. Both artifacts remain below 1 MiB.
- [x] Staged public `cu-windows-smoke` passes all seven declared evidence
  receipts: host self-test, DLL load cleanup, window identity, UIA tree,
  name-addressed actuation, Value/GetText wait and UIA fixture cleanup.
- [~] The six-cell artifact manifest and shared build path now include
  `agenterm-cu` plus the colocated `libagenterm` dynamic library on Linux and
  macOS as well as Windows. The macOS release signer signs and strictly verifies
  manifest libraries before executables. Static manifest/build/signing gates
  own this wiring; native Unix packaging, macOS signing/notarization and sealed
  Candidate artifact evidence remain open.
- [ ] Candidate and six-cell qualification and release evidence remain open.
  Passing local fixtures and staged public smoke does not promote this subtree
  root to shipped.
## Product outcome

- [~] `agenterm-cu` is AgenTerm's own computer-use foundation: one abstract
  command set for observing and controlling a machine — screenshot, window and
  control-tree enumeration, pointer, keyboard, clipboard, file transfer — that
  behaves identically whether the target is this machine or a remote one.
- [ ] it succeeds when an agent can drive a real desktop through one stable
  command surface, address controls by structured identity rather than guessed
  pixel coordinates, wait on observable state instead of sleeping, and have
  every action authorized and auditable.

## Why this product exists

- [ ] AgenTerm's north star is complete interface coverage: an agent must be
  able to control everything a human can and receive the same feedback. The
  terminal surface is largely covered; the machine outside the terminal is not.
  `agenterm-cu` closes that half.
- [ ] Living skill source is sibling-repo `moltbaby/skills/mcu` (`bin/mcu`).
  This product's job is to align that desktop-bridge surface (discover,
  a11y tree, local input, CDP page, verify, window geometry) onto the
  command / grant / `libagenterm` ABI — not to stay a Spectacle window-placer.
  Window placement ([32](PRD_02_32_cu_window_placement.md)) is one landed
  slice. When this product and AgenTerm are mature enough to replace the
  skill, `skills/mcu` archives and agents depend on this product line.
  Provenance: [14](PRD_02_14_research_provenance.md) (lessons, not a TS copy).
- [~] absorbed from that skill on 2026-08-30 (review and slices in
  [plan/design-mcu-absorption.md](../plan/design-mcu-absorption.md)): its
  default control loop `windows -> bounded query/tree -> invoke <selector>`,
  `verify --expect`, bounded tree acquisition (depth and node budget during
  traversal, truncation flagged), stable window handles with inventory
  filters, and its four invariants (background never steals the foreground,
  key focus or the real pointer; unsupported is fail-closed, never a silent
  global-input or sudo fallback; delivery is not success, every action says
  `verified` / `unverified`; destructive actions need an exact target, a
  prior snapshot and a checkable postcondition). Its shell / PTY / job /
  process domains are AgenTerm itself and the `.qjs` tool door, and stay out
  of cu; simulator, storage, device, network, power, privilege broker and the
  helper protocol are not absorbed. Each slice is proven by a `.qjs` journey
  (`scripts/qjs/cu-macos-smoke.qjs`, first) so the script engine is exercised
  by real computer-use scripts.
- [ ] the differentiator is direction, not parity. General computer-use tools
  drive a screen through screenshot + OCR + coordinate guessing. AgenTerm
  already publishes exact structured bounds through `ui-snapshot`, so AgenTerm
  can be the first computer-use **target** with a real control tree, not only a
  computer-use client. Both directions belong to this subtree, and the target
  direction must not be dropped in favor of the easier client direction.

## Naming

- [x] `agenterm-cu` is the accepted product name. It supersedes the
  `agenterm-remote.exe` working name used in
  [`plan/plan-v0.1.15.md`](../plan/plan-v0.1.15.md) §5.6.1. Remote protocol
  support is a transport axis inside this product, not a separate product.
- [x] `agenterm-cu` is also the only executable name. ABI diagnostics,
  command mode, and the desktop host are modes of that executable; a second
  `agenterm-cu` binary is not a product or compatibility surface.

## Product boundary

### Owned here

- The abstract command set and its layering contract ([29](PRD_02_29_cu_command_surface.md)).
- The target family and transport selection ([30](PRD_02_30_cu_targets_transports.md)).
- The authorization, audit and refusal model ([31](PRD_02_31_cu_authorization_safety.md)).
- Named window-placement actions and their geometry contract ([32](PRD_02_32_cu_window_placement.md)).

### Not owned here — must be consumed, not forked

This is the primary risk. AgenTerm already has four surfaces that take
screenshots or inject input. `agenterm-cu` must not become the fifth
independent implementation.

| 已有面 | owning 模块 | cu 的关系 |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| OS 级 screenshot / window / input / process 机制 | [20 Native platform](PRD_02_20_native_platform.md) `agenterm-platform` | **消费**。cu 不得直调 OS API，新机制先沉入 platform 并带 typed `Unsupported`/`Failed` |
| OS 级 accessibility-tree 机制（观察 + 节点动作） | `crates/agenterm-abi` libagenterm `agt_a11y_*`（里程碑 6）→ `agenterm-platform` 适配器 | **消费**。Linux `current` 的 `tree` / 结构化 `click` / `focus` / named `send-text` / focused `send-text --window` / named `copy` / focused `copy --window` / named `paste` / focused `paste --window` / named `send-keys` / focused `send-keys --window` 经 ABI 机制层，不在 cu 内复刻 AT-SPI/UIA/AX |
| 工作台观察/控制、确定性等待、身份 | [07 Agent control plane](PRD_02_07_agent_control_plane.md) | **不重叠**。cu 不为 agenterm 自己的 tab/PTY 提供第二条控制平面 |
| `agenterm-cc` 的 screenshot/snapshot 投影 | [21 Control Center](PRD_02_21_control_center.md) | **不重叠**。CC 是产品投影，不是通用机器控制面 |
| `agenterm-con cli` 的输入/截图/等待 | [26 con control CLI](https://github.com/partnernetsoftware/minicon/blob/main/prd/PRD_02_26_con_control_cli.md) | **不重叠**。con 是 GUI 生命期内的本进程终端控制 |
| 可选智能 / LLM 网关 | [12](PRD_02_12_specialized_intelligence.md) / [13](PRD_02_13_llm_gateway.md) | **独立**。cu 是工具面，不含模型、推理或提示策略 |

### Explicit non-goals

- [ ] no model, planner, prompt policy or agent loop. `agenterm-cu` provides
  capability, not judgment.
- [ ] no external computer-use framework, runtime or SDK is adopted into the
  product graph. Reference implementations may inform design; they are not
  dependencies. Provenance rules are owned by
  [14 Research provenance](PRD_02_14_research_provenance.md).
- [ ] no unrestricted-by-default authority. The unrestricted local runtime
  posture of [10 script engines](PRD_02_10_rhai_scripting.md) is explicitly
  **not** inherited; see [31](PRD_02_31_cu_authorization_safety.md).
- [ ] no silent capability substitution. An unavailable backend fails typed; it
  never degrades to coordinate guessing while reporting structured success.

## Governing invariants

- [ ] one command set across targets. `current` is the local degenerate tier of
  the same family as `ssh`/`rdp`/`vnc`, not a temporary special case. Adding a
  transport must not change the command surface above it.
- [ ] structured identity outranks pixels. Where a target can expose a control
  tree, commands address controls by structured identity with exact bounds;
  coordinate-only addressing is a declared fallback with an observable marker,
  never an invisible default.
- [ ] observation and action describe the same instant. A screenshot, a control
  tree and a subsequent action must be causally identifiable, so an agent can
  detect that the screen moved under it instead of acting on stale truth.
- [ ] every action is authorized before execution and observable after it. No
  action path exists that bypasses the authorization model or leaves no audit
  record.
- [ ] deterministic waits, never sleeps. Every state change an agent must
  observe is waitable with a bounded typed timeout.
- [ ] failures are typed and local. One target, session or backend failing must
  not corrupt another or abort the host.

## Promotion gates

- [ ] this subtree stays entirely `[ ]` at the root until the `current` tier
  proves the command set end to end on one platform with public black-box
  evidence. Individual child leaves may record `[~]` / `[x]` when their own
  evidence arrives; a partial platform slice does not promote the subtree root.
- [~] Linux `current` has black-box AT-SPI2 `tree` and structured actuation
  evidence. Windows `current` has staged public UIA tree, stable window/node
  identity, name-addressed Value/GetText/Invoke actuation, desktop-host cleanup,
  and shared host `Command`/`Executor` dispatch evidence in
  `scripts/rh/cu-windows-smoke.rh`. macOS AX remains a separate placement slice;
  Candidate qualification is still required before root promotion.
- [ ] the subtree root still has no shipped version. Roadmap ownership is
  [18 Focused product roadmap](PRD_02_18_roadmap.md). Window placement
  ([32](PRD_02_32_cu_window_placement.md)) opened under the v0.1.19 draft and
  is partially landed on macOS (command + day-driver host);
  that assignment does not promote this root or any other child.
- [ ] no capability may be marked shipped on design documents, reference
  assets, or a passing unit test alone. The evidence standard is the same as the
  rest of the tree: a public black-box journey against the real executable.
- [ ] when a child module's requirements outgrow it, it splits into a further
  module rather than accumulating a monolithic entry. This subtree exists
  precisely so that `agenterm-cu` never lands as one oversized bullet inside an
  unrelated module.

## Execution projection

Design and sequencing live in
[`plan/plan-v0.1.15.md`](../plan/plan-v0.1.15.md) §5.6 (mainline L-CU) and the
current-tier gap input
[`plan/agent-human-parity-audit.md`](../plan/agent-human-parity-audit.md).
Those are execution projections; accepted scope and status belong to this
subtree. Window-placement sequencing lives in
[`plan/plan-v0.1.19.md`](../plan/plan-v0.1.19.md); v0.1.18 remains the
in-progress unique version plan until it closes.
