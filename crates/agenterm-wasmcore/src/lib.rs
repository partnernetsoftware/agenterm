//! A real `wasmtime` + `wasmtime-wasi` (p1) host: loads and runs
//! `wasm32-wasip1` guest modules, and exposes to those guests the same
//! `fleet_call(operation_id, params_json) -> Result<result_json, error>`
//! bridge shape as `script_engine.rs`'s
//! `ScriptFleetBridgeFn = Arc<dyn Fn(&str, &str) -> Result<String, String> + Send + Sync>`
//! (the type every one of rh/lua/qjs's engine backends already shares).
//! This crate's whole value is exposing that exact capability to WASM
//! guests, not inventing a new one -- see `WasmFleetBridgeFn` below.
//!
//! # JIT, deliberately
//!
//! `wasmtime`'s default [`Engine`] uses the Cranelift JIT (real native
//! code, real RW->RX memory) -- this is an explicit, accepted design
//! choice for this crate. Earlier exploration crates (nativecore, guestcore,
//! dynacore) took a "never touch executable memory" approach; they are
//! archived at `plan/archive/crates-archived/`.
//! See `README.md` for the full ABI spec.
//!
//! # Calling convention (summary -- see `README.md` for the full ABI spec)
//!
//! WASM imports only carry `i32`/`i64`/`f32`/`f64` -- no strings. The
//! guest passes both input strings as `(ptr, len)` pairs into its own
//! linear memory, and passes the addresses of two guest-owned `i32`
//! out-parameters the host fills in with a `(ptr, len)` pair describing
//! its *own* freshly-allocated result buffer (obtained by the host calling
//! back into a guest-exported `wasmcore_alloc(len) -> ptr` allocator --
//! this crate never guesses a guest-owned buffer size, and never assumes
//! the guest's allocator layout). Full precise ABI: `README.md`.
//!
//! # Scope (this round)
//!
//! `wasm32-wasip1` only. No `wasm64`, no the component model / WASI p2,
//! and this crate is **not** wired into `execute_inner`/the product script
//! path yet -- same phased "prove the mechanism standalone first"
//! discipline every other crate in this session followed.
