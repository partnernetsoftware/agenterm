// Real wasm32-wasip1 WASI guest program, used by
// `agenterm-wasmcore`'s own integration test
// (`tests/fleet_call_roundtrip.rs`) to prove the `fleet_call` marshalling
// convention end to end -- no mocked bridge, no fake wasm bytes. Compiled
// at test time via:
//
//   rustc --target wasm32-wasip1 --edition 2021 -O guests/fleet_guest.rs -o <tmp>/fleet_guest.wasm
//
// Deliberately built by invoking `rustc` directly rather than being a
// second member of this crate's own Cargo compilation unit -- this is a
// *guest* binary for a *different* target triple, matching this session's
// own precedent of building verification programs out-of-band
// (`agenterm-guestcore`'s `examples/*.rs` are `cargo run --example`, a
// distinct mechanism again, but the same underlying principle: a
// verification artifact is not part of the crate's own build graph).
// `--edition 2021` is a deliberate, simple choice for this single-file
// program -- it predates edition 2024's `unsafe extern` block requirement,
// so this file can use a plain `extern "C" { .. }` block below without
// that ceremony.
//
// ABI this file implements (see ../README.md "fleet_call calling
// convention" for the full spec a non-Rust guest author would need):
//
//   import "agenterm" "fleet_call_into"
//     (op_ptr: i32, op_len: i32, params_ptr: i32, params_len: i32,
//      out_ptr_ptr: i32, out_len_ptr: i32) -> i32   (0=Ok, 1=Err, 2=NoBridge)
//
// This guest deliberately uses the **one-call** convention, which is what
// `fleet_call_into` is. The portable three-call convention -- `fleet_call`,
// `fleet_result_len`, `fleet_result`, the same names and arities
// `agenterm-qjswasm` offers -- is exercised by `tests/portable_door.rs`. Two
// guests, one per convention, because a guest that used both would prove
// neither is sufficient on its own.
//   export "wasmcore_alloc" (len: i32) -> i32
//   export "memory" (the wasm32-wasip1 default -- nothing extra to do)
