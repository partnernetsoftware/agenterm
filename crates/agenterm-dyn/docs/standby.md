# Archived handoff — Darwin probe waves

Updated 2026-08-15. The first-cut and hardening baselines are complete; the
authorized Darwin probe goal remains active. Wave 10 is catalogued; still no
JIT, C, or libffi.

Product remaining-work lives in [`prd/PRD_02_34_agenterm_dyn.md`](../../../prd/PRD_02_34_agenterm_dyn.md).
This note is the crate-side pointer so the next knife does not start from chat.

## Completed baseline

1. **first cut** — S-expr/intern/eval and fixed-width integer/pointer
   `dlcall` are shipped without C, libffi, or a fourth engine.
2. **harden** — void/arity/empty/blank/overlong/NUL names, C spelling aliases,
   and unsupported types (`f32` / `struct` / `f64` / `u128` / `usize` /
   `isize` / `bool`) reject before load/eval. Names accept 255 bytes and
   reject 256 bytes. Environment binding, interner, library, and native-symbol
   public binding and interner names reject interior NUL; script source NUL rejects in parsing;
   each environment retains at most 4,096 bindings and
   4,096 distinct symbols. The parser accepts 256 nested lists and rejects 257 with
   `DynError::Parse` before evaluation.
   Every top-level evaluation also shares a 1,000,000-iteration repeat budget;
   nested repeats reserve against it before their body executes and report
   `DynError::RepeatBudgetExceeded` when exhausted.
3. **probes** — Linux and macOS integer/void/ptr libc rows are live; Windows
   extra probes remain explicit placeholders. Unix `ioctl` (Linux and macOS) remains variadic
   script data, not a claimed fixed-trampoline success. `umask` restores its
   side effect. Linux caller-owned-pointer coverage includes `getcwd`, `uname`,
   `times`, `clock_gettime`, `getrusage`, and `getrlimit`. Wave 7 Darwin
   host/loader facts (`gethostname`, `confstr`, `clock_getres`,
   `pthread_is_threaded_np`, `_NSGetMachExecuteHeader`, `_dyld_get_image_name`,
   `_dyld_get_image_vmaddr_slide`) are catalogued; still no JIT, C, or libffi.
   Wave 8 Darwin loader/uuid facts (`dladdr`, `gethostuuid`,
   `_dyld_get_image_header`) are catalogued. Wave 9 adds bounded random,
   domain-name, and filesystem facts (`arc4random_uniform`, `getdomainname`,
   `statvfs`) without allocating a descriptor or Mach right. Wave 10
   catalogued wall-clock, supplementary-group, and path-resolution facts
   (`gettimeofday`, `getgroups`, `realpath`); still no JIT, C, or libffi.
   `mach_host_self` stays Placeholder.
4. **examples** — each shipped live probe has its paired S-expr document and
   README link.

Last Linux Wave 8 evidence, not a portable estimate: Rust 1.97
`cargo test --locked -p agenterm-dyn` passes **150** tests (25 unit, 40 errors,
11 hosts, 26 language, 48 Linux smoke; 0 doctests). The portable
`catalog_docs` gate adds 3 tests and passes on Windows. Wave 9 Darwin-native
receipt is **182**. Wave 10 catalogued `gettimeofday`, `getgroups`, and
`realpath`; Darwin inventory measurement is pending.

## Later product branches — require explicit authorization

Fold the intern tree to the host ISA; use wasmbin only as `.wat` / `.wasm`
export, not a VM; and consider libagenterm merge only when the crate is mature.
None is implemented, scheduled, or implicitly authorized.

## Still locked

No C/libffi. No JIT/sljit. No lambda/cons/strings. No cu/platform wiring.
No thickening libagenterm. Low-risk dyn commits go to `main` with `[skip ci]`.
