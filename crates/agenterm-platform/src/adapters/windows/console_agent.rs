//! A pseudoconsole for Windows builds that do not have one.
//!
//! ConPTY arrived in Windows 10 build 17763. On anything older — Windows
//! Server 2016 is 14393 and still in support — `CreatePseudoConsole` does not
//! exist, and Microsoft's ConPTY redistributable does not lower that floor
//! either: it supports 10.0.17763.0 and above, the same as the in-box API.
//!
//! What does work everywhere is the mechanism every terminal used before
//! ConPTY: put the child in its own *hidden* console, then read that console's
//! screen buffer and turn what changed into a terminal stream. The APIs
//! involved (`AllocConsole`, `ReadConsoleOutputW`, `WriteConsoleInputW`) are
//! as old as Win32.
//!
//! A process can be attached to only one console, so the scraping cannot
//! happen inside a GUI host. It runs in a separate agent process — this
//! executable, re-executed with [`AGENT_ARGUMENT`], so nothing third-party
//! enters the product.
//!
//! The agent speaks the same two pipes a pseudoconsole does: terminal bytes
//! out, input bytes in. Everything above the adapter therefore cannot tell
//! which backend it got, which is the whole point — the difference is sealed
//! here and not spread through the terminal.
