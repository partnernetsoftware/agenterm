//! Parity checks for agenterm's script-engine "L2 facade" — the fleet.*
//! scripting API surface that every engine exposes over
//! `__host.fleet_call(operation_id, params_json)` (lua/qjs) or the
//! equivalent compiled-in path (rh).
//!
//! Nothing else in the tree asserts these surfaces stay aligned, so drift
//! between engines would otherwise be silent. This file parses the actual
//! source artifacts (plain text/regex, no engine execution) and compares
//! the extracted (function/path -> operation_id) catalogs:
//!
//! 1. lua vs qjs: `scripts/lua/lib/fleet.lua` vs `scripts/qjs/lib/fleet.js`
//! 2. rh vs lua/qjs: `crates/agenterm-rh/src/shipped_surfaces.rs` vs the above
//! 3. every facade vs host: `src/operations.rs` `OPERATION_CATALOG` (the
//!    authoritative, dispatchable operation-id list)
//!
//! Investigation findings baked into this file:
//!
//! - lua and qjs are IN SYNC today: identical 29-entry (function_name ->
//!   operation_id) maps. Test 1 locks full equality.
//! - rh's `SHIPPED_SURFACE_PATHS` declares 76 `fleet.*` surface paths — a
//!   strict superset of lua/qjs's 29. rh's surface legitimately being wider
//!   (compiled-in, not hand-ported) is expected; this is documented and
//!   pinned rather than silently ignored. See `rh_only_operation_ids()` below.
//! - `src/operations.rs::OPERATION_CATALOG` is the authoritative,
//!   *dispatchable* operation-id list (`operation_by_id` looks entries up
//!   there; see `crates/agenterm-rh/src/fleet.rs`/`src/script_fleet.rs`
//!   callers). It has 77 entries, 76 of them `fleet.*`. Every lua/qjs
//!   operation_id is in it, and so is **every one of rh's 76 declared
//!   surfaces**: the two catalogs agree exactly.
//!
//! # Correction, 2026-08-25: the "33 undispatchable rh surfaces" were not real
//!
//! This file used to report that 32 (the allowlist held 33) of rh's declared
//! `fleet.*` surfaces had no entry in `OPERATION_CATALOG`, and named the
//! families: `ui.settings.*`, `ui.modal.*`, `ui.font.*`,
//! `ui.instance-picker.*`, `ui.window.*`, `ui.tab.new`, and so on. The figure
//! reached PRD 02.10 as an open product finding.
//!
//! It was an artefact of how this file read the catalog. The extractor scanned
//! `src/operations.rs` for lines starting `id:`, and those 33 entries are
//! built by the `nullary_ui_action()` const constructor on one line with no
//! `id:` on it. The extractor saw 44 of 77; the `>= 40` sanity floor passed;
//! nothing went red. A test that reads a source file with a regex can be wrong
//! in exactly this direction — quietly, and in the *reporting*, not the
//! assertion.
//!
//! `host_operation_catalog_ids()` now links `OPERATION_CATALOG` instead of
//! parsing it, the allowlist is empty, and the assertion that used to pin the
//! false gap now pins its absence. `tests/fleet_catalog_conformance.rs`
//! (2026-08-25) links the catalog the same way and covers the direction this
//! file does not: whether each binding's *parameters* match the spec.

// `crates/agenterm-rh/src/fleet.rs` (rh's AST-level transpiler, indirectly
// via the runtime host bridge) reject any operation_id that isn't in it.
//
// Investigation result:
//  - lua/qjs (29 operation_ids): a CLEAN SUBSET of the 44-entry
//    OPERATION_CATALOG. Nothing referenced by the script facades is
//    missing from the host's authoritative list. This is asserted as a
//    strict subset check (any new lua/qjs operation_id that isn't wired
//    into OPERATION_CATALOG will fail loudly).
//  - rh's declared `SHIPPED_SURFACE_PATHS` (76 fleet.* entries) is NOT a
//    subset: 32 of its declared operation ids have no entry in
//    OPERATION_CATALOG at all (e.g. `ui.settings.*`, `ui.modal.*`,
