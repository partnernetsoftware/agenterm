//! Cross-engine **CLI-level** verb parity for the four script engines (rh,
//! lua, qjs, sql). The standalone `agenterm-{rh,lua,qjs,sql}` `[[bin]]`
//! binaries are retired; every engine is now reached exclusively through the
//! root `agenterm` PE (`crates/agenterm-{rh,lua,qjs,sql}` remain as library
//! crates, just no longer packaged as their own executables) — see
//! `src/bin/agenterm.rs`'s `dispatch_engine` and
//! `plan/archive/design-script-engine-subcommands.md`.
//!
//! The capability-alignment contract (`plan/plan-v0.1.16.md` §1 Rh: "CLI
//! 动词对齐 ... 同样的 typed JSON 输出、退出码") has lib-level parity coverage
//! already (`tests/script_engine_parity.rs` drives each engine's
//! `check_many::{read_manifest, run_check_many}` directly), but nothing
//! before this file actually spawned the real binary and compared
//! its *observable* CLI behavior — argv shape, stdout, and exit code.
//! This file closes that gap. It does **not** duplicate the lib-level
//! `CheckManyReport` field-by-field assertions from `script_engine_parity.rs`
//! — it treats each engine as an opaque child process and asserts only what
//! a caller of the CLI can see: exit status and stdout/stderr substrings.
//!
//! `env!("CARGO_BIN_EXE_agenterm")` is used throughout (never `cargo build`
//! or a hand-rolled `target/` path) — Cargo builds the one binary
//! automatically before running this integration test binary.

//! # Exit-code conventions (read from each `main()`, not assumed)
//!
//! - **rh**: `main()` calls a typed `run() -> Result<(), RhError>` for most
//!   verbs: `Ok(())` → `ExitCode::SUCCESS` (0), `Err(_)` → eprint + generic
//!   `ExitCode::FAILURE` (1) — this is the path an *unknown verb* takes.
//!   `check` and `check-many` are special-cased in `main()` to their own
//!   `Result<u8, RhError>` handlers, translated by `public_command_exit_code`:
//!   `Ok(code)` → `ExitCode::from(code)` (so `check`'s own internal
//!   success/failure distinction is `Ok(0)`/`Ok(1)`, i.e. a syntax error is
//!   an `Ok`, not an `Err`), `Err(_)` (bad argv, unreadable manifest, etc.)
//!   → `ExitCode::from(2)`.
//! - **lua**: `main()` calls `dispatch() -> Result<u8, String>`; `Ok(code)`
//!   is passed straight to `std::process::exit`, `Err(_)` is **hardcoded to
//!   1** regardless of failure kind — lua has no typed 2/3 distinction at
//!   the top level the way rh/qjs/sql do. Notably, `cmd_check_many` also
//!   special-cases its *own* success/failure as `Ok(0)`/`Ok(1)` (ignoring
//!   `CheckManyReport::exit_code()`'s finer 2/3 taxonomy for
//!   configuration/limit failures), but a `read_manifest` failure (e.g. a
//!   wrong `kind`) happens before a report even exists and takes the
//!   generic `Err(String)` → hardcoded-1 path instead.
//! - **qjs / sql** (aligned 2026-08, see below): `main()` calls
//!   `run() -> Result<u8, QjsError | SqlError>`; `Ok(code)` →
//!   `ExitCode::from(code)`. `Err(_)` is no longer a blanket `2` — `main()`
//!   now reads the error's variant: `Parse`/`Check` (both script-level: the
//!   root cause is the script/pack content — syntax error, missing
//!   `entry()`, a thrown exception, a tampered pack, ...) → `1`; `Usage`
//!   (usage/configuration-level: bad argv, unknown verb, missing/unreadable
//!   flag or manifest, a `--project-root` that doesn't resolve/confine) →
//!   `2`. This mirrors the shared
//!   `agenterm_script_common::check_many::CheckManyReport::exit_code()`
//!   taxonomy's own `"script"` → 1 / `"configuration"` → 2 split, applied
//!   at the single-invocation CLI layer, not just inside `check-many`. See
//!   `crates/agenterm-{qjs,sql}/src/main.rs`'s module docs and
//!   `crates/agenterm-{qjs,sql}/src/error.rs`'s docs for the full
//!   call-site-by-call-site classification.

//! # Divergences this file locks down (found by running the real binaries)
//!
//! | scenario                                   | rh | lua | qjs | sql |
//! |----------------------------------------------|----|-----|-----|-----|
//! | `check <broken file>`                         | 1  | 1   | 1   | 1   |
//! | `check-many` with another engine's manifest `kind` | 2  | 1   | 2   | 2   |
//! | unknown verb                                   | 1  | 1   | 2   | 2   |
//!
//! `check <broken file>` is now unified across all four engines at exit 1
//! (2026-08: qjs/sql used to exit 2 here — a real bug, since it made a
//! syntax error indistinguishable from a usage error on those two engines;
//! see `crates/agenterm-{qjs,sql}/src/main.rs`'s module docs for the fix).
//! qjs/sql now correctly distinguish script-level (1) from
//! usage/configuration-level (2) failures at every CLI call site — the two
//! remaining rows are not qjs/sql being wrong, they're **rh/lua's own,
//! separate, tracked debt**: both fold *all* top-level failures (unknown
//! verb, bad manifest `kind`, ...) into a single generic 1-or-Ok(1) path
//! with no usage/script distinction at all, so "exit code == 1 means a
//! script-level failure, not a usage error" still does NOT hold for rh's
//! unknown-verb path or lua's `check-many`/unknown-verb paths. Fixing that
//! is out of scope here deliberately (rh risks Lnx-side wrapper breakage;
//! lua's track is separate) — tracked as rh/lua's own residue, not
//! re-litigated by this file.
//!
//! # Invocation axis (SUB-M4, `plan/archive/design-script-engine-subcommands.md` §4)
//!
//! Now that the standalone `agenterm-<engine>` binaries are retired, both
//! axis members are just the two ways `agenterm.rs`'s own dispatch reaches
//! `dispatch_engine`: [`Invocation::Internal`] spawns `agenterm
//! __agenterm-internal-engine <engine> <args>` directly (the worker-mode
//! marker `main()` forwards to in `INTERNAL_ENGINE_SUBCOMMAND`), and
//! [`Invocation::Subcommand`] spawns the public `agenterm <engine> <args>`
//! alias, which on Windows re-execs through the same duplicated-handle
//! console-worker the `cli`/`tui` subcommands use before landing on the same
//! internal marker, and on Unix calls the engine's entry point in-process
//! with no re-exec at all. Keeping both members (rather than collapsing to a
//! single public-only axis) is nearly free here — the axis machinery already
//! iterates `Invocation::ALL` and diffs the two outputs — and it still
//! catches the one thing that's genuinely different between them on
//! Windows: whether the console-worker re-exec hop changes observable
//! behavior. Each scenario's own assertions run once per invocation, and
//! [`assert_parity_across_invocations`] additionally asserts the exit code
//! and stdout are byte-for-byte identical across the two — the public alias
//! must be genuinely transparent over the internal marker, not just "close
//! enough".
